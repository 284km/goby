The following is the guideline (not rules) for contributing goby, I suggest you read them all before you start your contribution.

And I hope all contributors can join our [gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/goby-lang/Lobby).

## What to contribute

- Any issues you see, and if you think the ticket is confusing, please open an issue or ask me on [gitter](https://gitter.im/goby-lang/Lobby).
- Any grammar error in readme, wiki, and code comments...etc.
- Any issues litsted in goby's [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/goby-lang/goby/issues).
- Play around goby and report any bug you find.
- Write benchmarks for goby (we really need this and really haven't have time to do it yet üò¢)

**If you're interested in lexeing/parsing, please check `token`, `lexer`, `ast` and `parser` packages**

**If you're interested in compiler, check [bytecode specifications](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/wiki/Bytecode-Instruction-specs) and bytecode package's [tests](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/bytecode/generator_test.go) for some compiled examples.**

**If yor're interested in VM, please contact me directly since a lot things haven't been documented yet.**

**If you're a Ruby developer, you can start with adding methods to built in classes like [`Array`](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/vm/array.go) or [`Hash`](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/vm/hash.go).
And here's a [guideline](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/wiki/Contibuting-a-Method) for contributing built in methods**
